🛠️Update the input and output types to make sure we're always
🛠️adding two numbers together, returning a result of a number

💡As you type your code, any invalid parameters should show up in
💡your IDE, so that you're immediately aware that function parameters are invalid

const addTogether = (num1, num2) => {
	return num1 + num2;
}

addTogether(5, 10) // results in 15
addTogether(5, '10') // results in '510'
